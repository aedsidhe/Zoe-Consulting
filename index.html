    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>At NYU’s business school, my classmates would often talk about “selling their souls” to work on wall street. I wanted to avoid that, so after graduation I spent a year touring the country on a motorcycle and studying biblical symbolism. Looking for a place with a strong community, I came to Asheville after Helene to volunteer, thinking I would use my business degree. But when a friend of mine asked me to consult for her coffee shop, I found myself enjoying and excelling at the task. 
	Now, I help small businesses around Asheville to flourish, by developing business plans, strategies, and tools for moving static businesses towards eternal growth. Please reach out, I would love to help and always enjoy learning from business owners.
